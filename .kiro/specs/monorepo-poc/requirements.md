# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a proof-of-concept monorepo that demonstrates a full-stack application with shared validation schemas. The system consists of a Next.js frontend, a Nest.js backend, and a shared package containing Zod schemas for validation. The application implements a simple "hello world" validation flow where users input "hello" and receive "world" as a response. The system includes separate CI/CD pipelines for deploying the frontend and backend to EC2 instances.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a monorepo structure that organizes frontend, backend, and shared packages, so that I can maintain code consistency and share validation logic across applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a monorepo structure with separate packages for frontend, backend, and shared schemas
2. WHEN shared schemas are updated THEN both frontend and backend SHALL have access to the updated validation logic
3. WHEN building any package THEN the system SHALL resolve dependencies correctly across the monorepo

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to input text in a web interface, so that I can interact with the validation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I visit the frontend application THEN the system SHALL display an input field for text entry
2. WHEN I enter text in the input field THEN the system SHALL validate the input using shared Zod schemas
3. WHEN the input is valid THEN the system SHALL submit the data to the backend API

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system, I want to validate that user input equals "hello" using shared Zod schemas, so that both frontend and backend enforce the same validation rules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN input validation occurs THEN the system SHALL use the same Zod schema on both frontend and backend
2. WHEN the input equals "hello" THEN the validation SHALL pass
3. WHEN the input does not equal "hello" THEN the validation SHALL fail with appropriate error messages
4. WHEN frontend validation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages without making API calls

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a backend service, I want to receive and validate API requests, so that I can process only valid data and return appropriate responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a POST request is received THEN the system SHALL validate the request body using shared Zod schemas
2. WHEN the request body contains valid data (input equals "hello") THEN the system SHALL return "world" as response
3. WHEN the request body contains invalid data THEN the system SHALL return validation error messages
4. WHEN validation passes THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP 200 status
5. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL respond with HTTP 400 status

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want separate CI/CD pipelines for frontend and backend, so that I can deploy each service independently to EC2 instances.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN the system SHALL trigger separate GitHub Actions workflows for frontend and backend
2. WHEN the frontend workflow runs THEN it SHALL build the Next.js application and deploy it to an EC2 instance
3. WHEN the backend workflow runs THEN it SHALL build the Nest.js application and deploy it to a separate EC2 instance
4. WHEN deployment succeeds THEN the system SHALL make the applications accessible via their respective EC2 public URLs
5. WHEN shared schemas are updated THEN both frontend and backend deployments SHALL use the updated schemas

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want both frontend and backend applications to be containerized using Docker, so that I can ensure consistent deployment environments and include shared validation packages in the builds.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the frontend application THEN the system SHALL create a Docker image that includes the Next.js application and shared validation packages
2. WHEN building the backend application THEN the system SHALL create a Docker image that includes the Nest.js application and shared validation packages
3. WHEN Docker images are built THEN they SHALL properly resolve and include dependencies from the monorepo workspace
4. WHEN shared schemas are updated THEN the Docker build process SHALL include the latest validation packages in both frontend and backend images
5. WHEN CI/CD pipelines run THEN they SHALL build Docker images as part of the deployment process

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be as simple as possible for a POC, so that I can focus on demonstrating the core concepts without unnecessary complexity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the monorepo THEN the system SHALL use minimal configuration and dependencies
2. WHEN creating the validation flow THEN the system SHALL implement only the essential "hello" -> "world" functionality
3. WHEN setting up CI/CD THEN the system SHALL use straightforward deployment strategies without complex orchestration
4. WHEN structuring the code THEN the system SHALL prioritize clarity and simplicity over advanced patterns
